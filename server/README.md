# Back-End

To get started, run npm install.

npm run dev will start the dev server using nodemon to hot-reload all changes to index.ts, ts compiled to js in dist/index.js

Database Connection is through PG, make a copy of the example_env.txt file, save it as .env, fill in the credentials available on request from the dev team. Look at using Pool with PG, the export 'pool' will have all the methods attached. 

as of 230pm EST 3/15 this should all be working.
