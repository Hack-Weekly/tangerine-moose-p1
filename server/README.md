# Back-End

To get started, run npm install.

Start the server by running npm start. This will start a server which will hot reload the server as the dev is working on the app as to avoid restarting the server each time.

Database Connection is through PG, make a copy of the example_env.txt file, save it as .env, fill in the credentials available on request from the dev team. Look at using Pool with PG, the export 'pool' will have all the methods attached. 

as of 230pm EST 3/15 this should all be working.
